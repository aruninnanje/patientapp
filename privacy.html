    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>CareCompanion ("we", "our", "the Service") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your health information. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard your data.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
    <p>When you connect your healthcare provider account, the Service may access the following information through FHIR APIs with your explicit authorization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Patient demographics (name, date of birth, contact information)</li>
        <li>Medical conditions and diagnoses</li>
        <li>Current and past medications</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        <li>Vital signs and lab results</li>
        <li>Immunization records</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your health information is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your medical records to you within the Service</li>
        <li>Provide personalized health tracking and reminders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>

        <li>Use your health data for marketing purposes</li>
        <li>Store your healthcare portal login credentials</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Authentication and Authorization</h2>
    <p>CareCompanion uses OAuth2 (SMART on FHIR) for authentication. You authorize access through your healthcare provider's patient portal. We receive a secure access token but never your username or password.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data in transit (TLS/HTTPS)</li>
        <li>Encryption of data at rest</li>
        <li>Access controls and authentication requirements</li>
        <li>Regular security assessments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Health data retrieved from your provider is used for display purposes during your active session. You may revoke access at any time through your healthcare provider's patient portal settings.</p>

    <h2>7. HIPAA Compliance</h2>
    <p>CareCompanion handles protected health information (PHI) in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and applicable state regulations.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Revoke the Service's access to your health data at any time</li>
        <li>Request information about what data has been accessed</li>
        <li>Request deletion of any stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service connects to your healthcare provider's FHIR API to retrieve your health data. Your interaction with your healthcare provider's authentication system is governed by their own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
